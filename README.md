# 4FUT Pool Overview

- Initial fee is ZERO, there is no increase in fee until the pool get 5M ADA staked.
- All reward will be keeped in the pool until it reachs 100K ADA in pledge.
- Flat fee (fixed cost) is always 340 ADA (network pre-definition).
- Stake Pool Operators have experience in System Operations/Maintainance
- Dynamic fee/margin is competitive (current margin is 0%)
- Dynamic fee/margin will be adjusted by saturation level ( if the pool nearly saturated, the fee will be hight -> move to nex 4FUT Pool)

# System Overview

- All nodes is hosted in Digital Ocean IaaS.
- 4CPU/8GB Memory per node (40$/month/node).
- 1 node for relay (proxy/forward).
- 1 node for block producing.
- Current Up-time/availability commitment 99,9% (9 hours downtime per year)
- Up-time/availability could be improved by having more nodes and better resilience system (need slot reward to upgrade) 


# Our Commitments

- Flat fee will be used to maintain and upgrade the System.
- Margin will be no more than 1% (if the pool is saturated, higher fee is required to encourage delegator move to next 4FUT pool).
- A portion of margin will be funded to social/charity project.
